INTRO_EN = """# OpenFootballBase — data dictionary

Football club squads by season, built **only** from Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 4.0) and Wikidata (CC0).
This file describes the Parquet files of this release; it is generated at export time, from the files themselves.
[Version française : `SCHEMA.fr.md`](SCHEMA.fr.md).

## Layout of a release

- `manifest.json` — **entry point**: date, schema version, and for each file its path, row count and SHA-256 fingerprint.
- One file **per season** for `squad` and `club_season`; one file per table for the others.
- File names contain the first 8 characters of their fingerprint: `squad/2025-26.8fdfe5a8.parquet`. A file whose content does not change keeps its name (browser cache, comparison between releases).
- `frozen` seasons are immutable; the `open` season (the current one) changes at each release.

```json

## Reading the data

```sql

SELECT * FROM read_parquet('squad/*.parquet', union_by_name = true) WHERE club = 'Olympique de Marseille';

**A player's identity** is his Wikidata QID (`player_qid`). When it is empty (unidentified player), the fallback key is
`'name:' || player`; two unidentified namesakes cannot then be told apart.

## What to know before using the data

- **A squad is the union of several pages**: every language of the country is read and merged (`squad_source`, `squad.listed_in`) to be as complete as possible; a player may come from a page older or newer than the main one.
- **A squad is a snapshot**: the list published on the Wikipedia page at its update date, not the list of every player of the season. A player who joined or left mid-season may be missing.
- **In-season movements**: `stint = arrived_mid / left_mid` (with `stint_date`) read from the transfer tables of the **English** pages; club-seasons whose English page has no usable table stay `unknown`. A player who left mid-season is in his former club's squad (`left_mid`) and in his new club's (`arrived_mid`).
- **Loans**: a player loaned elsewhere (`loan_out`) is not in his parent club's squad; he is in the host club's (`stint = 'loan_in'`).
- **Career and caps** (appearances, goals): published as is from the Wikipedia infoboxes, **unverified**, and they may differ from one language to another.
- **Gaps**: squads that cannot be found are listed in `known_gap`; the other club-seasons without a squad have not been examined yet (`club_season.players = 0` with no reason).
- **Scripts**: stadium, league and city names in a non-Latin script are replaced by their English Wikidata label (empty if none exists).
- **Logos**: images hosted by Wikimedia, often non-free; use them for illustration only.
- **Ages**: compute from `birth` only if `precision = 11`.
- Licences: Wikipedia text CC BY-SA 4.0 (attribution: the source page is given by `source_title` / `source_revid`), Wikidata CC0.
