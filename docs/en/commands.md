# Command reference

[Français](../fr/commands.md)

Every command is written `openfootball <command> [options]` (after `source .venv/bin/activate`, or
`.venv/bin/openfootball …`). Unless stated otherwise, they work on the local database `data/work/openfootball.duckdb`
(`--db` to choose another one). **Only one writing command at a time** on a database.
Reminder: `export OPENFOOTBALL_CONTACT="your-contact"` before any command that queries Wikipedia/Wikidata.

## Build and validate squads

| Command | What it does | Useful options |
|---|---|---|
| `backfill --season Y` | Builds (or re-reads) the squads of season Y/Y+1 for every league declared in `openfootball/scopes/`. Refused if the season is frozen. | `--league FRA ITA` (restrict), `--open` (mark the season "open"), `--fresh` (ignore the cache: transfer-window update) |
| `uefa --cup UCL --season Y …` | Participants in the **group / league stage** of a European cup (`UCL` Champions League, `UEL` Europa League, `UECL` Conference League, `UC` UEFA Cup 2000–2008: 32 clubs of the round of 32 before 2004, the 40-club group stage after): records the entry (`competition_entry`), creates foreign clubs, their national league and their squad, then lists **all** the clubs of those national leagues (with or without a squad). Several seasons in one command, most recent first. Run **after** `backfill`. See [european-cups.md](european-cups.md). | `--cup UCL|UEL|UECL` (default `UCL`) |
| `continental --cup LIB CAF AFC --season Y …` | Participants (group or league stage) of the **Copa Libertadores** (`LIB`), the **CAF** Champions League (`CAF`) and the **AFC** Champions League (`AFC`): records the entry (`competition_entry`) and creates unknown clubs with their country. With **`--squads`**: reads the **squad** of the participating clubs instead (attached to the league of their country, created if needed); clubs without a season page stay empty and are shown as gaps. See [continental-cups.md](continental-cups.md). | `--cup` (default: all three), `--squads` |
| `complete-clubs --season Y …` | Reads the squad of **every top-flight season** of foreign clubs already seen in a European cup (at least one squad somewhere). Run after `uefa`. See [european-cups.md](european-cups.md). | `--refresh` (also re-reads those that already have a squad), `--fresh` (ignore the cache) |
| `restore-db --release data-X.Y.Z` | Recreates a working DuckDB database from a release (downloaded, local archive or extracted folder), after checking every file's SHA-256. Refuses to overwrite an existing database. See [restoring-a-database.md](restoring-a-database.md). | `--archive`, `--data`, `--db`, `--verify` |
| `fix-player "name" --lang fr --page "Title"` | Patch: links a name written on a club page (without a link) to the player's Wikipedia page (table `player_alias`). See [adding-clubs-and-seasons.md](adding-clubs-and-seasons.md) §6. | |
| `transfers` | Reads the transfer tables of "club season" pages: records dated movements (`squad_movement`), sets `loan_in` / `loan_out`, cross-checks loans between clubs and settles players present in two clubs in the same season. Never adds a player. **Run after every `backfill`** (it re-reads the cache, fast). | `--season Y` (one season) `transfers --from-careers` only marks, for players seen in two clubs the same season without a recorded move, which club came first, from the chronological order of their infobox career (`left_mid` / `arrived_mid`); nothing is guessed when the order is not adjacent or a spell is a loan. |
| `reconstruct` | Rebuilds the squad of a club-season that has none: previous season's squad − departures + arrivals from the transfer tables of its page. Rows are `inferred`, never `attested`; the gap stays documented. Not for frozen seasons. | `--season Y --club "Title" …` `--from-careers --season Y … --league CODE …` instead builds a **partial** squad from the players' careers (statistics tables, infobox) for club-seasons whose page does not exist; at least 10 players are required, without `--league` it targets continental-cup clubs. |
| `stats` | Reads the **"Career statistics"** section of the English Wikipedia page of every player of a club of France, England, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal or Germany in a Champions League season since 2010: appearances and goals by club, season and competition, then by national team and year. Only that section is cached (`cache/wikipedia_stats`). Values as published, unverified. | `--since Y`, `--country FRA ENG …`, `--all` (every player with an English page), `--limit N` |
| `honours` | **Honours**: the winner of each season of each competition, from Wikidata (winner P1346 of the season item, linked to the competition by P3450). Writes `competition_winner`, published as the `winner` table. Seasons whose winner Wikidata does not record are absent. Since 1.16.0 it also reads the winner of every season of the database missing on Wikidata from the infobox of the Wikipedia season page, and drops a Wikidata winner that is not among the participants of the season. |
| `awards` | **Ballon d'Or**: the ranking of every edition since 2000 (`--since`, `--until`), from the Wikipedia page "<year> Ballon d'Or". Writes `award_ranking`, published as the `award` table. |
| `status --season Y` | State of a season: established squads, gaps, invariants, warnings. | |
| `known-gap --season Y --reason "…"` | **Explicitly** validates club-seasons without a squad (the source does not exist). | `--club "Name"` (one club), `--all-unresolved` (every unvalidated gap) |
| `freeze --season Y` | Freezes a season: it becomes immutable (fingerprint recorded). Refused if an invariant fails or a gap is not validated. **Irreversible** without an amendment procedure. | |

## Identity, careers, enrichment

| Command | What it does | Useful options |
|---|---|---|
| `reconcile` | One player = one Wikidata QID; merges duplicates across languages. | |
| `reconcile --names` | Attaches players **without a link** to an identified player of the same name, only if his career contains the same club-seasons. **Run after every `backfill`.** | |
| `reconcile --wikidata` | For a player without a link: looks in Wikidata for a footballer of the same name whose clubs (P54) contain all our club-seasons; kept only if unique. Fast (a few minutes). | |
| `reconcile --infobox` | Looks for the English page of players without a link and validates it with its infobox. **Slow** (several hundred requests, about an hour) and low-yield on reruns: run occasionally. | |
| `careers` | Imports career **and caps** (English infobox) of players who do not have them yet. | `--refresh` (re-reads everything, from the cache: see [update-players.md](update-players.md)), `--active` (non-retired players), `--fresh` (ignore the cache), `--limit N` (trial) |
| `enrich --what players` | Wikipedia links per language and birth dates (hence ages). | |
| `enrich --what clubs` | Wikipedia links and French names of clubs with squads. | |
| `enrich --what careerclubs` | Links the clubs cited in careers to their record (QID). | |
| `enrich --what labels` | English labels of stadiums, leagues and cities in non-Latin scripts. | |
| `enrich --what logos` | Club logos (Wikipedia infobox): clubs with squads by default. | `--all-clubs`, `--logo-limit N`, `--refresh-logos` (also overwrites hand-set logos) — see [bulk-logos.md](bulk-logos.md) |
| `enrich` (no `--what`) | Everything: clubs, players, logos, labels, careerclubs. | |
| `import-world-clubs` | Merges the CSV of the ≈ 43,000 world clubs into the `club` table (idempotent). | `--csv path` |

## Tracking, export, publishing

| Command | What it does | Useful options |
|---|---|---|
| `progress` | Writes `PROGRESS.md`: progress by season and league, gaps, to-do. | `--out` |
| `export --out DIR` | Writes the Parquet files, `manifest.json` and the data dictionary (`SCHEMA.md` in English, `SCHEMA.fr.md` in French). | `--archive FILE.tar.gz` (release archive), `--previous manifest.json` (continuity guard: refuses the export if a frozen season changed) |
| `verify-release --new A --previous B` | Compares two manifests: a frozen season must not change. | |
| `schema --data DIR --out FILE` | Regenerates [data-model.md](data-model.md) (both languages: `docs/fr/` and `docs/en/`) from an export. | |

## Measurement tools (rarely useful)

`probe`, `probe-wikidata`, `probe-langs`: coverage surveys used to design the project
(existing "club season" pages, Wikidata fallback, other languages). They do not write to the database.

## Typical sequences

- **Full update**: `tools/refresh.sh --open-season 2026 2026` (see [adding-clubs-and-seasons.md](adding-clubs-and-seasons.md)).
- **Add a country**: one file `openfootball/scopes/<country>.toml`, then `backfill` season by season.
- **Publish**: [publishing-a-release.md](publishing-a-release.md).
